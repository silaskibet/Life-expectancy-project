# Life expectancy analysis in Kenyan counties project

This project explores and analyzes the factors influencing life expectancy across different counties in Kenya. Using a combination of statistical techniques and predictive modeling, I aimed to uncover key socio-economic, demographic, and health-related variables that impact life expectancy at the county level.

The analysis leverages data science tools to build predictive models and visualize patterns, providing valuable insights that can support public health planning, policy-making, and resource allocation in Kenya.

🚀 What’s Inside:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature engineering.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and descriptive statistics to understand county-level life expectancy patterns.

Predictive Modeling: Application of statistical and machine learning models to predict life expectancy based on selected predictors.

Model Evaluation: Assessment of model performance using appropriate metrics.

Key Findings & Insights: Summary of significant predictors and regional disparities in life expectancy.

🎯 Objective:

To use data-driven approaches to identify and predict the key drivers of life expectancy in Kenyan counties, providing actionable insights for public health stakeholders.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies:

Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

R (for statistical analysis & visualization)

Jupyter Notebook

Statistical Modelling Techniques

🌍 Why This Project:

This project is inspired by my interest in using data science for social impact. As someone who studied Statistics with IT , I’ve always been passionate about turning public data into meaningful, actionable insights.
